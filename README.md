# 🌧️ Rain Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using historical Australian weather data.  
The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and daily planning.  
This project builds a binary classification model to predict **RainTomorrow (Yes/No)** using meteorological features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Australian Weather Dataset
- Target Variable: `RainTomorrow`
- Problem Type: Binary Classification
- Features include:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Wind speed & direction
  - Rainfall
  - Location & date-based attributes

> ⚠️ The raw dataset is not included in this repository.  
> Please place the dataset locally before running the project.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and initial inspection  
2. Missing value analysis and handling  
3. Feature selection and column removal based on missingness and redundancy  
4. Categorical encoding  
5. Feature scaling  
6. Train–test split  
7. Model training and evaluation  
8. Model persistence  
9. Web application deployment using Streamlit

## 📈 Model Notes
- Missing value handling and categorical encoding were performed carefully to minimize data leakage.
- Feature selection was based on missing value thresholds and redundancy among meteorological variables.
- The model was evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure generalization to unseen data.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement full preprocessing pipelines using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- Compare multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Add CI/CD workflow for automated testing and deployment
- Dockerize the application for easier deployment and portability
